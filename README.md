# Credit Default Classification Project

This bake-off project aims to classify if an individual will default or not on their credit card payments.  Participants competed to build a classification model to predict on a hold-out dataset and achieve the highest F1 score and accuracy. 

## The Dataset
This dataset contains information about customers' credit card default payments in Taiwan. It was sourced from a study, "The comparisons of data mining techniques for the predictive accuracy of probability of default of credit card clients", that compares the predictive accuracy of probability of default among six data mining methods.
